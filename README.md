Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I’m currently a senior Computer Science major at Grand Valley State University, 
where I’m building a strong foundation in programming and software engineering through hands-on projects and collaboration.
My academic journey at GVSU has sharpened my problem-solving skills and prepared me for the dynamic field of computer science. 
I’m excited to explore more specialized areas and contribute to innovative solutions as I progress in my studies.
